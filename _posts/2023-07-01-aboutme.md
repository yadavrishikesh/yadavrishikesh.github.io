title: "About me"
---

I am a postdoctoral research fellow at [HEC Montréal](https://www.hec.ca/en/) and [McGill Univeristy](https://www.mcgill.ca/) working with Prof. [Leo Belzile](https://lbelzile.bitbucket.io/) and Prof. [Johanna Neslehova](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/neslehova/). I did my Ph.D. in 2022 in Statistics at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology [(KAUST)](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/), under the supervision of Prof. [Raphaël Huser](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/stat/people/person/raphael-huser). My PhD thesis is ["Bayesian Modeling of Sub-Asymptotic Spatial Extremes"](https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/handle/10754/676592). I obtained my Master's (M.Sc.) in Statistics from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur [(IITK)](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) in 2016 and Bachelor of Mathematics and Statistics in 2014 from the [University of Allahabad](https://www.allduniv.ac.in/)
