I am a postdoctoral research fellow at [HEC Montréal](https://www.hec.ca/en/) and [McGill Univeristy](https://www.mcgill.ca/) working with Prof. [Aurélie Labbe](https://www.hec.ca/en/profs/aurelie.labbe.html), decision science department, HEC Montreal, Prof. [Alexandra M. Schmidt](https://www.mcgill.ca/epi-biostat-occh/alexandra-m-schmidt), biostatistics department, McGill university, and Prof. [Pratheepa Jeganathan](https://experts.mcmaster.ca/display/jeganp1), department of mathematics and statistics, [McMaster university](https://www.mcmaster.ca/). I did my Ph.D. in 2022 in Statistics at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology [(KAUST)](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/), under the supervision of Prof. [Raphaël Huser](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/stat/people/person/raphael-huser). My PhD thesis is ["Bayesian Modeling of Sub-Asymptotic Spatial Extremes"](https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/handle/10754/676592). I obtained my Master's (M.Sc.) in Statistics from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur [(IITK)](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) in 2016 and Bachelor of Mathematics and Statistics in 2014 from the [University of Allahabad](https://www.allduniv.ac.in/)
